Add custom headers to each page/post/custom post type. Header options include: featured image, custom image, slideshows, HTML, scripts, and more. 

== Description ==

**Please Note:** This plugin is only for Genesis Framework users. Genesis is a premium product by [StudioPress](http://www.studiopress.com).

Originally designed to allow the easy addition of custom images and featured images to selected posts, this plugin was greatly expanded to provide a wide range of header content options. In addition, custom headers can be repositioned globally or locally using Genesis Hooks for greater flexibility. 

This plugin purposefully includes minimal styling so that custom headers can adapt to your site. That said, custom CSS will often need to be added to achieve the precise aesthetic you are looking for. Custom CSS can be added directly from the plugin Settings Page. If you have questions or would like to request additional features, let me know in the plugin support forum. 

= Header Content Options =
* Display the featured image
* Display a custom image
* Display slideshows using shortcodes or directly using one of the natively supported slider plugins
* Display custom content (Using the Wordpress tinymce editor)
* Display iframes, or raw HTML content (Great for Google maps) 
* Run page/post specific scripts 
* Set a global header position or page/post specific header positions using Genesis hooks
